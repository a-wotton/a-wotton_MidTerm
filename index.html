    <h3>Thor</h3>

    <p>
       Thor is the god of thunder, based off of the real Thor from Norse mythology. Thor is a god himself, and Superman is simply a souped-up alien from outer space. Thor wields the mighty hammer Mjolnir which can only be wielded by those who are worthy -- Superman could never lift the hammer. Superman is weak to kryptonite, all it takes is a small amount in order to render him helpless. Thor does not have any galring weaknesses like kryptonite.
